
In order for this driver to compile, Gladman's "cast.c" must be modified slightly.

In this distribution, the original file appears as "cast.c", and the modified version as "FreeOTFE_cast.c"

As can clearly be seen from diffing these files, the only change made is to the line:

#include "../std_defs.h"

which was changed to read:

#include "std_defs.h"
