

*) "RIPEMD-160" generates a straight RIPEMD-160 (160 bit) hash. "RIPEMD-160
   (Linux; Twice, with A)" is the RIPEMD160 hash as used by linux when
   "-H rmd160" is specified (e.g. with SuSE Linux).

   "RIPEMD-160 (Linux; Twice, with A)" hashes are generated as follows:

     1) Hash the user's key generating a 160 bit hash.
     2) Prepend the letter "A" onto the start of the user's key
     3) Hash the modififed key generating a second 160 bit hash.
     4) Add the second hash onto the end of the first hash, and return the
        result.
