<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">A: </span>If you are a native speaker of a language other than English, please take a look at
<A HREF="http://www.FreeOTFE.org/translations.html">translating FreeOTFE</A> page. FreeOTFE v4.3 introduced support for translating the user interface into different languages, though at present the actual number of translations into other languages is fairly limited.

<a name="ey"></a><b>Q: Which of the hash/cypher algorithms should I use?
<P>
A:</b> This decision is left up to the user.

<P>
Most users can simply accept the default algorithms offered, which provides a fairly high degree of security.


<P>
<HR class="half"> <!-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- -->
<a name="ez"></a><b>Q: Which of the random number generators (RNGs) should I use?
<P>
A:</b> This decision is left up to the user.

<P>
Using more than one RNG increases the security offered by FreeOTFE as the combined random data generated will be at least as random as the most random RNG selected. Should one of the RNGs subsequently be found to be weak (i.e. producing data that is not as random as it should be), the random data used will still be as strong as the strongest RNG used.

<a name="aa"></a><b>Q: Is FreeOTFE based on CrossCrypt?</b>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">A: </span>The answer to that is an
emphatic <span style="font-style: italic;">NO</span>! FreeOTFE and
CrossCrypt are two <span style="font-style: italic;">completely</span> separate projects, written by completely
different people.<br>

<p>It's easy to see why users may get the idea that FreeOTFE is based
on CrossCrypt; CrossCrypt was released first, and the CrossCrypt's GUI
(CrossCryptGUI) looks practically identical to FreeOTFE's interface.<br>

The reality is that <i>CrossCrypt</i> itself is a command line based OTFE system; it has no
GUI. <i>CrossCryptGUI</i> was a project I created to provide a GUI to
CrossCrypt to improve its ease of use.
<P>

In actual fact, far from FreeOTFE looking a lot like CrossCryptGUI, it's
actually the other way around - CrossCryptGUI looks a lot like FreeOTFE! The
Delphi GUI to FreeOTFE was already developed before CrossCrypt was
released. For the sake of expediency, I dropped the CrossCrypt Delphi
component I wrote into FreeOTFE's GUI, hijacking it to produce
CrossCryptGUI; a
cannibalized version of the FreeOTFE interface.
<P>

The cyphers supplied with the first public release of FreeOTFE
(v00.00.01) were the same as those used by CrossCrypt. Originally I had
planned
to release the first beta of FreeOTFE for compatibility testing with
only the NULL, XOR, DES and AES cyphers; these apparently being the
most common cyphers used with Linux volumes. After CrossCrypt was
released (which uses AES and Twofish) DES was the only cypher in
the above list I had not implemented. I decided to switch from DES
to Twofish in order that people without Linux could easily use
CrossCrypt to verify that FreeOTFE was operating correctly with AES and
Twofish volumes (and vice versa; benefiting both systems).
<P>

Since its initial release, FreeOTFE has seen significant
developments, including support for many more hashes, cyphers, and
other options.

<a name="ab"></a><span style="font-weight: bold;">Q: Is FreeOTFE based
on Linux's "losetup"?</span>
<P>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">
A:</span> No, FreeOTFE is a completely separate project in its own
right. It

A:</span> This is unlikely to happen

I do the same with my ext2/ext3/RiserFS/etc volume, I can't see my

<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">A:</span> FreeOTFE does one thing:
when a volume file is mounted, FreeOTFE presents a new storage device
to the operating system.<br>

Like all OTFE systems, it has no comprehension <span style="font-style: italic;">at all</span> of what FAT/FAT32/NTFS, let
alone ext2/ext3/etc - this understanding lies well <span style="font-style: italic;">outside the scope of an OTFE system</span>,
and is the responsibility of the filesystem drivers installed.
<P>

Although MS Windows does come with filesystem drivers for
FAT/FAT32/NTFS, it does not (natively) support other filesystems such
as
ext2.
<P>

As a result, in order to read/write to your encrypted Linux volumes
under MS Windows, you will need to either:<br>

<ol>

<li>Format the volume under Linux using one of the filesystems MS
Windows understands (e.g. FAT), or
<li>Install 3rd party software on your MS Windows system, which
provides the filesystem (e.g. ext2) that you wish to use

Q: Why do the Linux examples for LUKS/dm-crypt volumes show "losetup" being used twice?

<P>
A:</b> This actually has <i>nothing</i> to do with FreeOTFE(!), but appears to be an oddity with "mkdosfs"/dm-crypt.

<P>

Although this section of the documentation shows:
<br>

<blockquote>
<pre>losetup /dev/loop1 /dev/mapper/myMapper<br>mkdosfs /dev/loop1<br></pre>
</blockquote>

you should be able to simply use:
<br>

<blockquote>
<pre>mkdosfs /dev/mapper/myMapper<br></pre>
</blockquote>

However, when this section of the documentation was written and
tested (under Fedora Core 3, with a v2.6.11.7 kernel installed and
using cryptsetup-luks v1.0), this shorter (and more sensible) version
resulted in mkdosfs generating the following error:
<br>

<blockquote>
<pre># mkdosfs /dev/mapper/myMapper<br>mkdosfs 2.8 (28 Feb 2001)<br>mkdosfs: unable to get drive geometry for '/dev/mapper/myMapper'<br></pre>
</blockquote>

YMMV, though you may well find that formatting the volume with a
different filesystem will remove the "double loop" issue. (Please note
though, that if you are intending to encrypted volumes which don't use
FAT/NTFS under MS Windows, you will need a suitable filesystem driver)

In practice however, although partition based volumes may be able to realise volumes as large as this, 
file-based volumes may find that limitations with the filesystem that the volume file is to be stored
upon may prevent this limit from being reached.

<P>
For example, a FAT32 drive cannot store a volume file which is
4GB or larger. In practical terms, this means that the largest volume you can

<P>

A: As with pretty much <span style="font-style: italic;">all</span> OTFE systems, if you were to corrupt a FreeOTFE volume is some way, the damage
your data would receive would be about the same as if you had stored it
directly on your hard drive, without FreeOTFE encrypting it.
<P>

For example: If you mount a FreeOTFE volume file and then write a byte
of data, at random, to somewhere on that mounted drive, the effect
would be exactly the same as if you had randomly written the same byte
to a real hard drive.
<P>

On the other hand, if you were to write a byte to data to a random
location within an umounted FreeOTFE volume, then the amount of damage
caused would dependant on where that byte was written:<br>

<ol>

<li>If the volume file was created with a critical data block (CDB)
at the start of it, and the byte was written to the first 512 bytes of
the volume file (where the CDB is located), then the volume would be
unmountable, unless you had made a backup of this area of your volume,
or created a keyfile - in which case, you could restore from your
backup/mount from your keyfile, and continue as if nothing had happened.
<li>If the volume file was created without a critical data block, or
the byte was written to any other part of your volume file, then the
sector that corresponded to the location that the byte was written to
would be corrupted from approximately the point the byte was written, to
the end of that sector; a maximum of 512 bytes.<br>

</ol>

To protect against (1), FreeOTFE included functionality to backup a
volume's CDB (see "Tools | Critical data block... | Backup..."), and to
create keyfiles (see "Tools | Create keyfile...")<br>

Should case (2) occur, the damage to your volume would be minimal
(up to a maximum of 512 bytes), and restricted to the sector
that was corrupted.

<a name="de"></a><span style="font-weight: bold;">Q: Is FreeOTFE vulnerable to "Cold Boot Attacks on Encryption Keys" (aka "DRAM attacks")?
</span>

<P>

<b>A:</b> 

No, it isn't - assuming common sense is used.
<P>
<I>Description</I>

<P>
A "cold boot attack" involves rebooting a computer which has been handling sensitive information, and dumping contents of its memory out to a 
disk in order to try to examine information stored in memory immediately prior to rebooting. This form of attack is
detailed at <A HREF="http://citp.princeton.edu/memory/faq/">http://citp.princeton.edu/memory/</A>

<P>

This attack is <I>nothing new</I>, and has been well known for a <I>long</I> time; despite the disproportionate amount of attention it's now getting.
<P>
<I>Solution</I>


<P>
If you mount an OTFE volume, and simply walk away from your computer, the encryption keys used to secure your volume will be held in your computer's physical 
memory (obviously). If someone reboots your computer at that point, there is a risk they could successfully recover your encryption key.

<P>
However, it is not generally recommended that you simply <I>walk away from your computer while you have volumes mounted</I> - if anyone can come along and 
attempt to launch the above attack, THEY CAN SIMPLY READ THE CONTENTS OF YOUR ENCRYPTED VOLUME DIRECTLY ANYWAY!

<P>
If you dismount your volumes after using them, the FreeOTFE driver overwrites all sensitive data (key information, etc) that 
it holds before releasing it - which should prevent the above attack.

<P>
If you suddenly press your computer's power off button or reset it (i.e. using the physical "power off" button on the front of its case) <I>while a volume is 
mounted</I>, then an attacker could theoretically dump out your encryption keys using this attack. Please note that:

<OL>
<LI><I>All</I> encryption systems are susceptible to this attack, since they have to store encryption keys in memory in order to use them
<LI><I>Regardless of whether you use any form of disk encryption or not</I>, it is not recommended that you do power off/reset your computer without first shutting down cleanly via the "Start -> Turn off computer"!
</OL>

<P>
To prevent this attack in the situation described above, ensure that the computer remains powered off for several minutes after it is turned off in order for the contents 
of RAM to effectively "bleed away"

<P>
<I>Summary</I>

<P>
In summary, to completely remove the threat of this attack against your encryption keys:

<OL>
<LI>Dismount volumes after you have used them
<LI>If you must power off your computer <I>while one or more volumes are mounted</I>: prevent anyone from powering it back on and dumping it's memory out for 
at least the first few minutes after it was powered off (or the first 15-20 minutes if they open up the case and spray coolant on the memory chips)
</OL>

In short - just use common sense.

<P>
<I>Notes</I>

<P>
It should be noted that this attack is <I>not limited in any way to disk encryption systems</I>. The focus on these systems by the authors of the above paper is a red 
herring. Essentially the attack consists of attempting to take a snapshot of the PC's memory at the time it was reset, which can then be picked over at 
leisure. <I>Any</I> encryption system can be attacked in this way.

<P>
Furthermore, because this attack may allow whatever was in the computer's memory at the point it was rebooted to be recovered, it should also be noted that any 
information that applications had in memory at the time the computer is reset (e.g. a document open in MS Word, or image being displayed on the screen) may potentially be 
recovered. Disk encryption systems encrypt data stored on disks - not in RAM.

<a name="gd"></a><b>Q: How do I resize an encrypted volume?
<P>
A:</b> To change the size of an encrypted volume:

<OL>
<LI>Mount your existing volume
<LI>Create a new FreeOTFE volume of the size required
<LI>Mount the new volume (overwriting and formatting it if needed)
<LI>Copy all data from the old volume to the new one

<P>
Obviously, this procedure requires enough storage space to hold both the old and newly created volumes.

<P>
It should be noted that, although a number of <I>other</I> disk encryption systems <I>claim</I> to offer volume resizing functionality, they typically either carrying out the procedure above "behind the scenes" (often failing completely if insufficient storage is available to hold the new volume), or by storing the volume in a "sparse" files - which can lead to security leaks.

<HR class="half"> <!-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- -->
<a name="et"></a><b>Q: How do I backup an encrypted volume?
<P>
A:</b> How you backup an encrypted volume depends on whether it is a file or
partition based volume. In both cases however, volumes should be
<I>dismounted</I> before being backed up.

<P>
<B>For file based volumes</B>

<P>
A file based volume is a file just like any other (albeit a
fairly big one); simply let your backup software backup the volume as
it chooses, and your data should be safe.

<P>
This will work regardless of what backup software you use, though you may wish to turn off FreeOTFE's timestamp reverting functionality in order for your backup software to identify when volumes have been changed. (See "View | Options..." dialog, "General" tab, "Revert volume timestamps on dismount")

<P>
<B>For disk/partition based volumes</B>

<P>
Whether you can backup disk/partition based volumes depends on the
backup software being used. If your backup software takes a <I>literal</I>
backup image of a disk/partition, then it should successfully backup
FreeOTFE volumes (even if the backup copy is compressed). However, not
all backup systems do this, and instead try to be "smart" about what
they store to backup - and fail to backup everything they need to.

<P>
(This issue is true for all disk encryption systems, not just FreeOTFE)

<P>
For example, with <A HREF="http://www.paragon-software.com/">Paragon Drive Backup</A>,
if you create an encrypted volume using an <I>entire disk</I>
(i.e. without creating a partition on the disk, and encrypting that partition),
Paragon Drive
doesn't appear to think there's anything worth backing up (i.e. it
doesn't see any partitions <I>to</I> backup) and therefore backs up 
practically nothing. As a result, it will <I>not</I> back up your volume
correctly.

<P>
However! If you create an encrypted volume on a <I>partition</I> (even
one filling the entire drive), and back that partition up, Paragon Drive Backup
does what it <I>should</I> do - generates a compressed backup copy of the
<I>entire</I> partition, which can then be restored back later.

<a name="hi"></a><b>Q: When dismounting a file based volume, what does FreeOTFE do with the file timestamps?
<P>
A:</b> 
By default, when mounting file based volumes, FreeOTFE stores the volume file's timestamps, and resets them back again after dismounting. This is carried out for security reasons (see section on <A HREF="plausible_deniability.htm">plausible deniability</A>).

<P>
This functionality can be turned off if needed (e.g. to assist backup processes; see FAQ "<A HREF="#et">How do I backup an encrypted volume?</A>") by turning off the "Revert volume timestamps on dismount" option on the Options dialog ("View | Options").

<HR class="half"> <!-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- -->
<a name="hi"></a><b>Q: What is volume "padding", and why would I want it?
<P>
A:</b> 
A number of tools are available to "detect" encrypted volumes. These typically operate
by detecting large files with a high amount of entropy and a file size that is a multiple of 512 bytes, or which is a certain "signature size" greater than the last 1MB boundary.

<P>
"Padding" is additional (random) data added to the end of the volume, and is used to prevent detection of FreeOTFE volumes by automated volume-finding tools which only carry out a cursory search for volumes, and rely on the size of files found.

<P>
Furthermore, padding also reduces the amount of information an attacker has about a volume, by preventing reliable detection of the size of the mounted volume (subject to the mounted volume being overwritten as described in the <A HREF="plausible_deniability.htm">Plausible Deniability</A> section).

<P>
Padding will not prevent a reasonably knowledgeable IT person from being able to reasonably identify an encrypted volume as such - like any security mechanism, padding is simply another tool which would be employed from a larger toolbox. For this reason, it is <I>not</I> recommended that padding be relied upon to help secure data against an attacker, and users considering using padding may benefit from reading the section on <A HREF="plausible_deniability.htm">"Plausible Deniability"</A>

<HR class="half"> <!-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- -->

<P>

<b>A:</b> 

By creating a shortcut with suitable command line parameters in your
"Startup" directory (click the MS Windows "Start" button, then go to
"Programs | Startup"), FreeOTFE can mount volume files after your
system starts up/you login.
<P>

See the <a href="command_line.htm">Command Line Interface</a> section for full details of FreeOTFE's command line options.
<P>

<HR class="half"> <!-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- -->
<a name="cd"></a><b>
Q: On the options dialog, what does the "Save above settings to" option do?

<P>
A:</b> This allows you to change where your FreeOTFE settings are
stored; in your user profile (only accessible to you), or with the
FreeOTFE executable (which is useful if you want to take FreeOTFE with
you; on a USB drive, for example).

<P>

You may also choose to not save your settings; in which case, the next
time you start FreeOTFE, you will begin again with the default options.

<P>

<HR class="half"> <!-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- -->
<a name="ce"></a><b>
Q: Can I save my settings in the same directory as my FreeOTFE executable?

<P>
A:</b> Yes, you can - and this makes FreeOTFE more portable, and
easier to use, if you want to take it with you on (for example) a USB
drive.

<P>

There is only one exception though; if you are using Windows Vista, and
have User Account Control (UAC) switched on, you will not be allowed to
store your settings with the FreeOTFE executable <i>if it is stored under your "Program Files" directory</i>.
This is due to one of the limitations imposed by Windows Vista's
security system; though you are still free to store FreeOTFE's settings
in your user profile.

<P>

<HR class="half"> <!-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- -->
<a name="cf"></a><b>
Q: Where, and in what order does FreeOTFE search for my settings?

<P>
A:</b> If you have chosen to save your settings, FreeOTFE will
store them un a "FreeOTFE.ini" file stored on your computer at your
chosen location

<P>

When it starts up, FreeOTFE will attempt to locate this file and read
in your settings, by first checking for it in the same directory the
executable (FreeOTFE.exe) was located in. If a settings file cannot be
found in this location, it will try and look for the same file in your
user's profile. If a settings file still cannot be found, FreeOTFE
will fallback to using configured default values for all settings.

<a name="ch"></a><b>Q: After associating FreeOTFE with ".vol" files

<P>
A:</b> The FreeOTFE drivers must be running in order for you to
mount a volume by doubleclicking on it. Please either install the
FreeOTFE drivers (see the <a href="installation_and_upgrading__PC.htm">installation section</a>), or start FreeOTFE's portable mode (see <a href="portable_mode.htm">portable mode</a> section).

Q: Why do volumes created with the FreeOTFE v2.00 and later have the extension ".vol"?

<P>
A:</b> This is purely to maintain consistency with the PDA version (see <a href="">other FAQ</a>

FreeOTFE gives you complete freedom over what you name your volume
files.

<a name="em"></a><b>Q: What is the difference between the "Overwrite free space..." and "Overwrite entire drive..." options under the "Tools" menu?
<P>
A:</b> These options are largely self-explanatory.

<P>
The "Overwrite free space.." option will simply overwrite all <I>unused</I> storage on the selected volume.

<P>
The "Overwrite entire drive.." option is more destructive - it will overwrite <I>all</I> storage on the selected volume - including overwriting (destroying) any data that may have been present on it.

<P>
Because the latter option is more destructive, it may only be used when a single mounted volume has been selected within the FreeOTFE user interface.


<P>
<HR class="half"> <!-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- -->
<a name="eo"></a><b>Q: Does FreeOTFE support encrypting data with multiple cyphers (aka "cascaded" cyphers, or "superencryption")
<P>
A:</b> Yes! FreeOTFE allows volumes to be nested one inside another, with <I>complete</I> flexibility as to which encryption options are used with each volume.

<P>
This means that you can (for example) have:

<UL>
<LI>An AES XTS (with SHA-512) encrypted volume, stored within
<LI>A Blowfish LRW (using Tiger) encrypted volume, stored within
<LI>A Serpent CBC-ESSIV (using RIPEMD-320)encrypted volume
</UL>

<P>
In this example, any data stored within the "innermost" AES encrypted volume will be actually be triple-encrypted with AES, Blowfish and Serpent before written to disk.

<P>
Obviously, there is a performance impact in encrypting data more than once - as there would be in any system which encrypts data multiple times.

<P>
It's debatable how much this will increases security by, though in principle the "innermost" volume, in which sensitve files are stored, will be secured at least as strongly as the strongest cypher used. Should any of the cyphers be found to be weak at a later date, this will still hold true.

<P>
Note: Volumes nested in this manner must be dismounted in the <I>reverse</I> order to which they were mounted.

A:</b> Yes! There are two things that you may wish to defragment:

<OL>
<LI>(File based volumes only) The drive on which the volume file is stored (i.e. defragmenting a volume file) 

<P>
Once dismounted, a volume file can be treated <I>just like any other file</I>. Volume files can be defragmented by then running <I>any</I> defragmentation tool on the drive it's stored on.

<LI>The filesystem stored within the encrypted volume (i.e. defragmenting the encrypted files stored within the volume)

<P>
By mounting a volume, you can defragment the encrypted data stored within it. Again, you can use any tool for this, with the exception of:

<a name="db"></a><b>Q: Can I use FreeOTFE with "MojoPac"?
<P>
A:</b> Yes!

<p>
There are two basic ways of encrypting you data using FreeOTFE while using MojoPac:

<ol>

<li>By creating an encrypted volume and installing MojoPac onto it.
<li>By installing MojoPac as normal (e.g. onto a USB drive), and running FreeOTFE from within MojoPac

</ol>

<p>
<b>Method one: Installing onto a FreeOTFE volume</b>

<p>
The first method is probably the more secure, as your <i>entire</i> MojoPac setup is encrypted. Simply create a new FreeOTFE volume 
on your USB drive, mount it, and then install MojoPac onto the mounted volume.

<p>
In this way <i>everything</i> relating to your MojoPac system
will be secured. Because of FreeOTFE's portable mode, MojoPac can be
used as a fully mobile, secured, system by placing a copy of FreeOTFE
onto your USB drive along with the volume file. 

<p>
<b>Method two: Running within the MojoPac environment</b>

<p>
FreeOTFE can also be launched and used from within the MojoPac
environment to create and use encrypted volumes in much the same way as
on a normal PC.

<p>
In order to use FreeOTFE in this way, you must first either

<ul>

<li>Start FreeOTFE's portable mode on the <i>host PC</i>, or
<li>Install and start the FreeOTFE drivers on the <i>host PC</i>

</ul>

<p>
(See the <a href="portable_mode.htm">Portable mode</a> and <a href="installation_and_upgrading__PC.htm">Installation</a> sections for further information)

<p>
When running MojoPac, your MojoPac device (i.e. your USB drive, iPod, etc) will appear as <i>both</i> the removable drive it is normally mounted as on the host PC (e.g. D:, E:), and as your MojoPac's C: drive.

<p>
To mount a FreeOTFE volume which is stored on your <i>MojoPac device</i>, you should select the volume file on the removable drive (e.g. D:, E:) and <i>not</i> the mirror copy which appears on you MojoPac's C: drive. Mounting volumes stored elsewhere should be unaffected.

<p>
Note that when a volume is mounted from within the MojoPac environment, it may also be accessed by the <i>host PC</i>
by using the drive letter it is mounted as under the MojoPac session.
Applications on the host PC will see the mounted volume as normal, with
the exception of Windows Explorer which will not show a new drive icon
for it - though even then, it can still be accessed by Windows Explorer
on the host PC, by simply typing the drive letter the encrypted volume
is mounted as, followed by a colon, into Windows Explorer's "Address"
bar and pressing &lt;ENTER&gt;.

<p>
In the same manner, volumes mounted on the host PC will be accessible from within the MojoPac environment.

<a name="bj"></a><span style="font-weight: bold;">Q: After creating an encrypted partition/disk, MS Windows reports that
partition I used as being type "RAW" and prompts me to format it - why?</span>

<P>

<b>A:</b> 

After creating an encrypted partition/disk, if you have a drive
letter associated with the physical partition used, MS Windows will
report that drive as being "RAW" since it cannot understand what is
stored on it (for obvious reasons, it can't understand what the
encrypted data means).
<P>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">WARNING:</span> Do not let MS Windows
format this partition! Although formatting the "virtual drive" FreeOTFE
creates after mounting your encrypted partition is certainly a
requirement before it can be used, formatting the partition it resides
on could destroy your encrypted data!
<P>

The safest course of action is to prevent MS Windows from allocating a drive letter to the encrypted partition. By doing so:<br>

<ul>

<li>MS Windows will not prompt you every time this drive is accessed, since you will not be able to accidentally access it<br>
<li>You'll be less likely to hit "OK" and format the partition, overwriting your encrypted data!

When this happens, FreeOTFE will fallback to displaying a more restricted set of information (e.g. no partition sizes)

any kind of recovery, understand what you are going to do and how you are going to do it - <I>before</I> doing

<a name="bo"></a><span style="font-weight: bold;">Q: (Windows Vista only) Why do I get "unidentified program wants access to your computer" prompts when using FreeOTFE?</span>

<P>

<span style="font-style: italic;">(This FAQ is only applicable when running under Windows Vista and later; it is not relevant for other operating systems)</span>
<P>

<b>A:</b> 

Windows Vista incorporates a new security system called "User
Access Control" (UAC), which is there to help prevent malicious
software from doing things which could be harmful to your computer.
<P>

Whenever you attempt to use any part of FreeOTFE's functionality which
Windows considers a malicious program could use to cause harm, Windows
displays this dialog (called the "consent/credential" dialog), and asks
you if you would give your permission for it to continue. You will be
shown this dialog even if you are logged on as an Administrator.
<P>

The same type of dialog will appear when you attempt to (for example)
go to Window's Control Panel, selecting "Date and Time", and then
attempting to change the computer's time or date.
<P>

Because the FreeOTFE executable does not have a digital signature that
Windows recognises, this dialog claims that "An unidentified program
wants access to your computer". This is perfectly normal, and part of
Vista's system to help protect you. If you would like to check that
your copy of FreeOTFE is an original, you may do so by checking the
hashes/signatures available from the <a href="http://www.FreeOTFE.org/">FreeOTFE WWW site</a>.
<P>

These prompts form part of Windows Vista's "User Access Control" (UAC) system, which you can find out more about from the <a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/windowsvista/aa906022.aspx">Microsoft WWW site</a>.

<span style="font-style: italic;">(This FAQ is only applicable when running under Windows Vista and later; it is not relevant for other operating systems)</span>
<P>

<b>A:</b> 

FreeOTFE <span style="font-style: italic;">doesn't</span> ask you to enter an Administrator's password; it has no use or need for this information. Windows Vista, however, <span style="font-style: italic;">will </span>prompt
you to enter an Administrator's password whenever you are logged in as
a "standard" (i.e. non-Administrator) user, and attempt to carry out
any operation which it deems could be harmful to your computer.
<P>

If you are happy for FreeOTFE to carry out the operation you requested
of it, you should select the relevant option from the
consent/credential dialog, and enter the appropriate Administrator's
password to allow FreeOTFE to proceed.
<P>

Those operations which require Administrator's explicit approval before
Windows Vista will permit you to carry them out are marked in FreeOTFE
with a "shield icon".
<P>

It should be emphasised that it is Windows Vista itself which is
generating these prompts, and not FreeOTFE, which will have no access
to the password you type in. 
<P>

These prompts form part of Windows Vista's "User Access Control" (UAC) system, which you can find out more about from the <a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/windowsvista/aa906022.aspx">Microsoft WWW site</a>.

<a name="bl"></a><span style="font-weight: bold;">Q: I created my
volume file using the PDA version of FreeOTFE and can mount it on my PC
- but why does it keep asking if I want to format it?</span>

<P>

<b>A:</b> 

When you created your volume on your PDA, your PDA fully formatted
the volume as though it was a new device - not just a partition on a device.
<P>

In order for a volume to be mounted and used correctly on both a PDA
and PC, it should be created and formatted using a PC as a FAT volume,
and subject to the maximum volume size your PDA can support (see <a href="FAQ.htm#as">FAQ on volume sizes</a><span style="text-decoration: underline;">)</span>. This will ensure it can be read on all systems.

<a name="ep"></a><span style="font-weight: bold;">Q: I created a volume on my PC, and can mount it successfully on my PDA - but can't see any of my files!</span>

<P>
<b>A:</b> 

The chances are that you formatted your volume on your PC using NTFS, and your PDA doesn't support this filesystem.

<P>
Volumes which are to be used on a PDA should normally be formatted as FAT or FAT32; this should be carried out on a PC, not a PDA (see <A HREF="#bl">related FAQ</A>).

<P>
Please note also that FAT32 can only support volumes up to (4GB less one byte)


<P>
<HR class="half"> <!-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- -->
<a name="bm"></a><span style="font-weight: bold;">Q: How can I speed FreeOTFE up when mounting my volumes?</span>


<P>

<b>A:</b> 

For security reasons, FreeOTFE doesn't store any information
relating to which hash/cypher combination was used to encrypt a
FreeOTFE volume.
<P>

As a result, FreeOTFE is forced to cycle through all of its
possible hash/cypher combinations in order to determine which one to
use. Reducing the number of combinations it has to check can
significantly reduce the time this takes.
<P>

To reduce the number of combinations, <span style="font-style: italic;">without</span>
making any difference to the level of security FreeOTFE offers, simply
disable any redundant cypher/hash implementation drivers such as either one of:

<BR>

<ul>
  <li>FreeOTFE4PDACypherAES_Gladman.dll
  <li>FreeOTFE4PDACypherAES_ltc.dll
</ul>

and any two of:<br>

<ul>
  <li>FreeOTFE4PDACypherTwofish_Gladman.dll
  <li>FreeOTFE4PDACypherTwofish_HifnCS.dll
  <li>FreeOTFE4PDACypherTwofish_ltc.dll
</ul>

Please see <A HREF="advanced_topics.htm">Advanced Topics</A>, "Enabling/Disabling Hash/Cypher Algorithms" section, for instructions on how to enable/disable hash/cypher drivers.

<P>
(Please see the <a href="#bc">FAQ on duplicated drivers</a> for an explanation as to why multiple implementations are included in the release)
<P>

The mount time can be reduced even more dramatically by disabling all of
the hash/cypher drivers <I>except</I> for the ones which you have secured
your data with. This however could decrease the level of security
offered, as doing so would make it pretty clear to any attacker which
combination you've used - though it's debatable whether this loss in
security will actually be of any practical value to an attacker.
<P>

To speed things up even further, you could drop the number of key
iterations your volume is secured with. This isn't particularly
recommended, but might help some users...

<a name="co"></a><b>Q: When I use the "open" dialog to select my
volume file/keyfile, it doesn't list the file I'm trying to specify -
even when I select "All files" - where is it?

<P>
A:</b> The standard Windows Mobile "open file" dialog is a little odd; this isn't just restricted to FreeOTFE!

<P>

Although FreeOTFE allows you the freedom to use <i>any</i> filename
you wish, only files which have a filename extension (i.e. the volume's
filename has a full stop followed by one or more letters) will be
listed in the "open file" dialog; even if you selected the display "All
files" option.

<P>

Furthermore, this dialog will only display those files located in the following places:
<br>

<ul>

<li>Any subdirectory on a storage card which is located from the root directory of that storage card.
<li>Files in the "My Documents" directory on your PDA
<li>Files in any subdirectory immediately underneath your "My Documents" directory<br>

</ul>

The simplest solution is to rename your file, and move it into one of the directories indicated above.

<P>

Alternatively, you can still specify your file by simply typing its
full path and filename into the relevant entry box, instead of clicking
"..." and using the "open file" dialog to select it.

<P>

Note that you don't <i>need</i> a filename extension, and can store volume/key files <i>anywhere</i>
on your PDA. Conforming to the above restrictions allows you to use the
"open file" dialog to select your files, and does not affect FreeOTFE's
operation in any way.

<a name="cz"></a><b>Q: How can I reduce the amount of storage space FreeOTFE4PDA takes up when installed?
<P>
A:</b> The easiest way of reducing FreeOTFE4PDA's installed
"footprint" is to delete its user documentation from your PDA (i.e.
everything in the "docs" subdirectory).

<P>

You don't (or at least, shouldn't!) <i>really</i> need this
documentation as FreeOTFE4PDA is a pretty straightforward application
to use - and if you do find you want to refer to it occasionally,
tapping on "Help | User guide" will take you to the online version if a
local copy cannot be found.

<P>

It is recommended that you keep a copy <i>somewhere</i> though; on your desktop PC, if nowhere else.


<P>

You can further reduce the amount of storage taken up by deleting
any unused cypher and hash drivers; this will also increase the speed
at which FreeOTFE4PDA will mount volumes. (See FAQ: "<a href="#bm">How can I speed FreeOTFE up when mounting my volumes?</a>" for further details on how to do this)


<P>
If you don't need any of the language translations (or only one of them), deleting those translations you <I>don't</I> need from the "locale" subdirectory can free off a small amount more storage.
