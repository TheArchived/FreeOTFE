    <li>Added option to explore drive automatically after mounting
    <li>Made volume file
timestamp reversion optional (i.e. the timestamps on volume files are
automatically set back to their pre-mount values on dismounting;
previously it would always do this)<br>

easily be displayed by clicking button. (Advanced mount options can be
displayed by default by setting relevant option)<br>

successfully mounted, or the user cancels the mount when mounting
a FreeOTFE volume<br>
    
</ul>
  <ul>
    <li>Multiple driver files can now be selected for installation when manually installing drivers<br>
    
    <li>"File
| Mount" now also auto detects LUKS volumes, so they can be mounted via
this menuitem as well as "File | Linux volume | Mount file...".
Similarly, dragging and dropping files onto FreeOTFE will cause it to
attempt to auto detect the type of volume used.<br>

      <li>Microsoft Visual Studio 2005 Professional Edition
    </ul>(although older versions can probably still be used)<li>Updated LibTomCrypt based cypher/hash drivers to use LibTomCrypt v1.17<br>
    
  </ul>

  <li>v2.00.00 (18th March 2007)
  <ul>
    <li>Implemented support for Windows Vista (although
previous versions would work under Vista, they had a few minor cosmetic issues under this OS)<br>
    
    <li>Added option to allow mounted volumes to be visible to all logged on users, or just the current user<br>
    
<li>Added
option to associate ".vol" files with FreeOTFE, in line with the PDA
version, and defaulted open/save dialog filters. (Note that you are
still free to use <span style="font-style: italic;">any</span> filename with any filename extension).<br>
<li>Added ability to store FreeOTFE settings in different places, or not at all if required<br>
    
    <li>Updated to automatically prompt user if they want to start portable mode if the main FreeOTFE driver isn't installed/running
<li>Added indicator to show portable mode activating<li>Added ability to combine random number generators (RNGs) when generating random data for new volumes/changing passwords<li>Added option to start FreeOTFE in portable mode without prompting if no installed drivers are found<br>
    
    <li>Added option to suppress prompting for volume type when volume files are drag 'n' dropped onto FreeOTFE
    <li>Added
additional prompt when creating new volumes to make it clearer when the
minimum amount of information required had been entered
<li>Added option to allow user to specify where their settings should be stored (if they are to be saved)</ul><ul><li>Added
extra support for "odd" LUKS volumes which don't use the same cypher keylength for IV
generation as encrypting data (e.g. volumes which use Blowfish-448 for data encryption, and cbc-essiv:sha256
actually use Blowfish-256 for their ESSIV IVs - this is now supported)<br>
    
<li>Added detection of (nonstandard) Tiger and Whirlpool hashes when using LUKS volumes<li>Removed redundant warning about drivers not being started in portable mode when they had been manually installed
    <li>Corrected minor cosmetic issue with status bar display<li>Added OS version ID to human readable CDB dumps<li>Moved weaker drivers (FreeOTFE4PDAHashNull.dll, FreeOTFE4PDACypherNull.dll
and FreeOTFE4PDACypherXOR.dll) into a "weak drivers" directory; most
users shouldn't use these drivers, but they're still included in the
release if needed

  </ul>

  <li>v1.60.00 (28th January 2006)
<ul><li>Added the following cyphers:
    <ul>
<li>CAST6 (Gladman library)<br>

    </ul>
<li>Fixed minor bug that prevented FreeOTFE from properly dismounting volumes under certain conditions.<li>Corrected build error that prevented previous version from operating correctly under MS Windows 2000<br>
    
  </ul>
  <li>v1.50.00 (8th January 2006)

  <ul>
    <li>Changed email address from sdean12@softhome.net to (finally!) sdean12@sdean12.org<li>Added the following cyphers:

    <ul>
      <li>Serpent<li>AES (Gladman library)
      <li>RC-6 (Gladman library)<br>
      
      <li>Twofish (Gladman library)<li>MARS (Gladman library; source only pending licence clarification)

    </ul><li>Updated to allow volumes to be mounted across networks<li>Added ability to resize the driver control dialog
<li>Corrected fault that prevented LUKS partitions from being mounted<li>Added
support for LUKS volumes which use ESSIV, subject to the hashlength of
the ESSIV hash generating the same number or less bits as the cypher
used. Note: Although LUKS can create volumes with ESSIV - ESSIV is <span style="font-style: italic;">not</span> part of the LUKS specification!<br>
    
<li>Corrected errors that were displayed when a non-admin attempted to access the driver control dialog<br>
    
  </ul>
  <li>v1.00.00 (20th November 2005)

  <li>v0.59.00 BETA (29th July 2005)

  <ul>
    <li>Minor change to FreeOTFE.sys device driver to fix error
introduced by compiler. Specifically, debug builds work correctly, but
for release builds the compiler handles the "%" (modulus) operator
differently for 64 bit arithmetic; calling a kernel function
("_alldvrm") that doesn't exist in Windows 2000, causing the driver to
fail to load.<br>
    
  </ul>
  <li>v0.58.00 BETA (24th July 2005)<br>
    <ul>
      <li>Added support for cryptlib (cl32.dll) as an RNG, if installed
      <li>Added support for Linux LUKS volumes
      <li>Removed redundant warnings when run by a user without Administrative privileges

    <ul>
      <li>Added support for encrypted CDs/DVDs
      <li>Added support for encrypting disk devices, as well as
partitions (i.e. You can now encrypt an entire disk, not just
partitions held on it)
    </ul>
  
  <li>v00.57.00 BETA (28th May 2005)

  <ul>
    <li>Compatibility with Linux volumes improved
    <li>Fixed bug found when creating a new volume and storing the
volume's CDB separately. (The CDB file wasn't being created before the
CDB was written to it, causing an "Unable to write critical data block"
error.)<br>
    
  </ul>
  <li>v00.56.00 BETA (7th May 2005 - restricted release)
  <ul>
    <li>Corrected issues relating to formatting volumes<br>

    <li>Added warning to user if an attempt is made to use a volume file created with a later volume format layout ID.
    <li>Corrected fault with Windows XP/Windows 2000 differing
QueryDosDevice behaviour that sometimes prevented FreeOTFE listing all
cyphers/hash algorithms installed.
    <li>Updated to only accept drag 'n dropped files when the drivers are active.
    <li>Extra checks included to ensure user has at least one hash and cypher driver installed and running.
    <li>Fixed MB/GB selection in new volume creation.
    <li>More sensible saving/loading of Linux encryption settings.
    <li>Added prompt when exiting if volumes are still mounted.<br>
    
  </ul>
  <li>v00.53.00 BETA (24th April 2005 - restricted release)
  <ul>
    <li>Fixed major bug causing the main driver to ignore its queue when large amounts of data were written to an encrypted volume.
    <li>Improved emergency dismount (dismounts faster by cancelling all queued requests to the driver).
    <li>Improved progress dialog's responsiveness when overwriting free
space, preventing it from appearing frozen and giving user a better
indication of progress.
    <li>Fixed minor cosmetic fault on the keyfile creation dialog.
    <li>FreeOTFE volume creation wizard now gives user more flexibility to specify the sector IV generation method used.
    <li>Added support for Linux dm-crypt volumes (e.g. ESSIV).
    <li>Added progress dialog when creating volume files.
    <li>Message shown when FreeOTFE exits and stops portable mode no
longer displayed, unless there was a problem stopping portable mode.<br>
    
  </ul>

  <ul>
    <li>Implementation of "portable mode"<li>Added support for keyfiles<li>User passwords are no longer displayed; they are blanked out with "*" characters
    <li>Added option to backup and restore the CDB from volumes with a CDB
    <li>Added option to dump critical data block to a human readable file
    <li>Driver control dialog now indicates state of drivers - making it a <span style="font-style: italic;">lot</span> clearer what's happening!
    <li>Added support for encrypted partitions
    <li>User can now change their passwords, and many other FreeOTFE volume properties.<br>
    
    <li>When volume files
are mounted and used, their timestamps (created, last accessed and last
modified) and attributes are recorded. They are then reset on dismount.<br>
    
    <li>Volume file timestamps and attributes are reset after dismounting, improving "plausible deniability"
    <li>Added ability to save settings when mounting Linux volumes
    <li>Volumes can now be mounted as removable drives (no recycle bin, files deleted directly)
    <li>User's password is now processed with PKCS#5 PBKDF2 (HMAC), instead of being salted and hashed.
    <li>Improved handling if more than one hash/cypher can be used for encryption/decryption.<br>
    
    <li>Added the following cyphers:
    <ul>

      <li>DES<br>
    
      <li>3DES<br>
    
      <li>Blowfish<br>

    </ul>
    <li>Added the following hash algorithms:
    <ul>

      <li>Tiger

      <li>Whirlpool<br>

    </ul>
    <li>Added per-volume IVs
    <li>Rewrote most of the driver control dialog
    <li>Critical data block checksum now uses the HMAC of the volume details block, instead of its hash
    <li>Fixed
bug that could cause new volumes to be created with an extra newline
tacked onto the end of the user's password. If you have problems
mounting volumes created like this, you should still be able to mount
them by entering an extra newline (just press &lt;ENTER&gt;) at the end
of your password.
    <li>Fixed bug that caused VolumeFlags to be read back from the volume
incorrectly. In order to continue support for older (CDB format 1)
volumes, these volumes will still be read incorrectly, but newer (CDB
format 2) volumes are processed correctly. To update older volumes to
use the later CDB format, simply change your password via the "Tools |
Change volume/keyfile password/details..." menuitem. It is highly
recommended that you do this anyway, in order to better ensure future
compatibility<br>

  <li>v0.00.02 BETA 1 (11th October 2004)

  <ul>
    <li>Fix to correct bug with salt handling which prevented FreeOTFE
volumes from being mounted.<br>
    
  </ul>
  <li>v0.00.01 BETA 1 (10th October 2004)
  <ul>
    <li>First public release for
compatibility testing
