<h2>Installation and Upgrading from a Previous Version: PC Version</h2>


<B>NOTE: Windows Vista x64 (64 bit) users <I>only</I> should <I>also</I> read the <A HREF="impact_of_kernel_driver_signing.htm">additional information for Windows Vista x64 users</A> section, in order to configure their system before use</B>

<P>
As with the PDA version, if you wish to use FreeOTFE in portable mode, you do <span style="font-style: italic;">not </span>have
to carry
out the installation described below; simply copy the binary (".exe"
and ".sys") files to wherever you would like them stored, and
doubleclick on "FreeOTFE.exe" (i.e. the file with the combination
lock icon). From there, you can then start using FreeOTFE in <a href="portable_mode.htm">Portable Mode</a>.
<P>
Alternatively, if you would like to carry out a full installation, which
will allow non-administrator users to mount and use FreeOTFE volumes, follow <I>either</I> of the automatic or manuall installation instructions detailed below.

<P>
<P>
<HR class="half"> <!-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- -->
<A NAME="level_3_heading_1"><H3>Automatic installation</H3></A>


<OL>
<LI>Download the "installer" version of FreeOTFE, and run the executable.
<LI>After prompting you for some simple details, FreeOTFE will be automatically installed on your PC.
</OL>

<P>
If you are using the 64 bit version of Windows Vista (Vista x64), you will have to reboot your PC after the automatic installation is complete.

<P>
<P>
<HR class="half"> <!-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- -->
<A NAME="level_3_heading_2"><H3>Manual installation</H3></A>


<ol>

  <li>Uncompress the release ZIP to where you would the software installed. 
  <li>Login to your computer as administrator (if
appropriate) - installation of the device drivers requires
administrator privileges to create the registry entries, etc
  <li>Create shortcuts to "FreeOTFE.exe", if required.
  <li>Launch "FreeOTFE.exe". You will be prompted that the
system could not connect to the main FreeOTFE driver - ignore this
error for now as you have not yet installed the main FreeOTFE driver.</li>
  <li>Select
"File | Drivers...". If you are running under Windows Vista, you will
see the standard UAC consent/credential dialog at this point because
you are about to install a device driver, which requires Administrator
privileges. Authorise FreeOTFE to continue by clicking "Allow" or
entering your Administrator's password to continue.<li>Install each of the ".sys" files included with the release in turn, as follows:

  <ol>
    <li>Click the "Install..." button
    <li>Select the ".sys" file to be installed from the release, and click
"OK". (This should copy the driver file into your
&lt;windows&gt;\system32\drivers dir, and setup a few registry entries)
    <li>Select the driver's name which should now appear in the list of installed drivers, and
click "Start". (This should start the driver selected)</li>
    <li>Change the driver's startup option to "At system startup" and click "Update"
  </ol>

  <li>Click the "Close" button
</ol>

These steps will install and setup a FreeOTFE in a minimalist
installation. With these steps complete, you may now use FreeOTFE to
create and mount FreeOTFE and Linux encrypted volumes.
<P>
The drivers installed are
configured such that they <span style="font-style: italic;">do not
automatically startup when your system boots</span>. Once you are happy
that FreeOTFE is stable enough, you may
return to the driver management dialog, select each driver in turn, and
set them to start automatically at
system startup.
<P>

Note: In order to use FreeOTFE, you <span style="font-style: italic;">must
</span>have the following drivers <span style="font-style: italic;">installed</span>,
and <span style="font-style: italic;">running</span> as the bare
minimum for FreeOTFE to operate correctly:<br>

<ol>

  <li>The main "FreeOTFE" driver</li>
  <li>At least one hash driver ("FreeOTFEHash...")</li>
  <li>At least one cypher driver ("FreeOTFECypher...")</li>
</ol>
A number of the cyphers (e.g. RC6 and Twofish) have multiple
drivers; these reflect different implementations (e.g. FreeOTFE comes
with three Twofish implementations; one based on the libtomcrypt
library, one based on the optimised reference implementation, and one
based on Brian Gladman's implementation). Each of these drivers
provides pretty much the same functionality, it's just the
implementation that differs.&nbsp; <span style="font-style: italic;">Were multiple drivers are provided for the same cypher, you only need to install one of them</span>. You <span style="font-style: italic;">can </span>mix
drivers based on different implementations (e.g. install the Gladman
version of Twofish, while installing the libtomcrypt version of AES).
Installing <span style="font-style: italic;">all </span>of the drivers
them is harmless, but does mean that you'll be prompted which one to
use during mounting a volume, if more than one can be used to
encrypt/decrypt that volume.<br>

<A NAME="level_4_heading_1"><H4>Upgrading from a Previous Version</H4></A>


Because of potential changes
within the driver API, you must ensure that you completely
uninstall your existing FreeOTFE installation before installing and
using the latest version. Please see the section on <a href="uninstalling.htm">uninstalling</a> for details on how to do this.<br>

<A NAME="level_5_heading_1"><H5>Special Notes if Upgrading from v2.00</H5></A>

Although the FreeOTFE drivers are backwardly compatible, v2.00 of the
main FreeOTFE driver cannot correctly use LRW or XTS encrypted volumes.
Such volumes may be mounted with the v2.00 driver, but their contents
will not be usable.<br>

<A NAME="level_5_heading_2"><H5>Special Notes if Upgrading from v00.00.02</H5></A>


With the possible exception of those volumes which were generated using
the "NULL" hash algorithm (which was only intended for testing purposes), the latest version of FreeOTFE should be
backward compatible with existing volume files and you should
experience no problems with mounting and using them.
<P>

You will notice that when mounting volumes, you are presented with more
options than with your previous version of FreeOTFE. For the purposes of
mounting older volumes, these additional controls can be ignored
<span style="font-style: italic;">except for the "salt length" option</span>.
Newer versions of FreeOTFE default this value to 256 bits, and you may well
have to change this to the previous default of 128 bits. 
<P>

When mounting FreeOTFE volumes, FreeOTFE will
attempt to mount using the latest CDB format,
only falling back and attempting to mount using the older CDB format if this
fails.
<P>

Although FreeOTFE is backward compatible with existing volumes, it is <span style="font-style: italic;">very highly recommended</span> that
you update your volume files to ensure that they use the new CDB
format, as this will allow you to take advantage of the numerous
security improvements that the latest version provides. The easiest way
to update your volume files to the new CDB format is to simply change
their passwords by selecting
"Tools | Change volume/keyfile password/details...".
<P>

IMPORTANT: If you created any ".les" (Linux Encryption Settings) files,
please double check the next time you reload them, and ensure that your
settings are correct. Changes due to ongoing development <span style="font-style: italic;">may</span> cause some settings to change; to fix, simply confirm your settings are correct, and save them out again.
