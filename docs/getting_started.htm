Pretty much everything in FreeOTFE works as it seems, and should be
fairly self explanatory. If there's anything you're not too
sure of, most times an educated guess will give you the right answer.

<A NAME="level_3_heading_1"><H3>Installation/Portable mode</H3></A>

<P>
Before FreeOTFE can be used, it must first either be installed or uncompressed from the releaes archive.

<P>
Please see the section on <A HREF="installation_and_upgrading.htm">Installation and Upgrading</A> for instructions on how to do this.

<P>
<HR class="half"> <!-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- -->
<A NAME="level_3_heading_2"><H3>Using FreeOTFE</H3></A>

<P>
Once FreeOTFE is installed (or started in portable mode), securing your data is simple:

<OL>
<LI>Create a volume to store your encrypted data on (or several, if you choose!)
<LI>Mount the volume created.
<LI>Once mounted, your volume will appear as a new drive (a "virtual drive") on your system.

<P>
<I>Anything</I> and <I>everything</I> stored on this drive (documents, pictures, videos, software - whatever you like) will be automatically encrypted and stored within the volume you created, at the point that it's written to the drive.

<P>
The encryption process is totally transparent to the user, and is
carried out on-the-fly as data is written to the drive. Similarly,
decryption is carried out transparently when data is read from it.

<P>
You can drag files to and from this drive, open and save files from applications to it, run applications directly from it - in fact, <I>everything</I> that you can do with a normal drive, you can do with a FreeOTFE virtual drive.

<LI>To secure your data, simply dismount the drive. At that point,
the drive disappears and the encryption/decryption key is overwritten
in memory - making your data totally inaccessable until the password
(and other parameters, if needed) are supplied, and the volume is
mounted again.

</OL>

<P>
The following sections give more detailed instructions on how do carry out each of these steps.

<P>
<HR class="half"> <!-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- -->
<A NAME="level_3_heading_3"><H3>Creating a new volume</H3></A>

<P>
In order to use FreeOTFE, you must first create a "disk image" (called a "volume") to represent your virtual drive.

<P>
This is a fairly straightforward process, and consists of using FreeOTFE to create a large file (or setup a partition) on your computer's hard drive. 

<P>

 
<TABLE class="note" align="CENTER">
  <TR>
    <TD>
<img src="./images/note_Technical.png" alt="Technical note" >
    </TD>
    <TD width=100%>

This volume will hold an encrypted "disk image" of your virtual drive, and is where FreeOTFE will store all data written to your virtual drive.
    </TD>
  </TR>
</TABLE>



<P>
This file (or partition) can subsequently be "mounted", at which point a virtual drive will appear on your computer - anything stored on one of these virtual drives will be automatically encrypted before being written to volume file.

<P>
To create a new volume, select "File | New..." menuitem to display the "new volume wizard", which will guide you through the process in a series of simple steps.

<P>
When prompted to select between creating a file or partition based volume, new users should select "File". This is the safer of the two options - partition based volumes are intended for more advanced users.

<P>
Some users who are unfamiliar with disk encryption systems may not understand all of the options they are presented with. If you feel that you are in this position, you should probably simply accept the default values you are presented with, which will give you a volume that will be secure enough for your needs. 

<P>
FreeOTFE is a highly flexible system that caters for both novice and advanced users alike; many of the options that the volume creation wizard provides you with are intended for more advanced users who understand the implications of the options provided (e.g. storing a volume's CDB separately to the volume file it relates to), and how they operate.

Select "File | Mount file..." menuitem to mount a file based volume, or "File | Mount partition..." to mount a partition based volume.

<P>
If this is the first time you have mounted a particular volume after creating it, you will need to format the virtual drive before it can be used. To do so, select the mounted volume shown in the main FreeOTFE window, and select the "Tools | Format..." menuitem. The standard MS Windows format utility will be displayed, and should be used to carry out the format.

<P>
If you wish to use your volume on both PCs <I>and</I> PDAs, or with FreeOTFE Explorer, it should be formatted on a PC as either FAT or FAT32 (see also the FAQ on <A HREF="FAQ.htm#bl">PDA formatting.</A>)

  <TR>
    <TD>
<img src="./images/note_SecurityTip.png" alt="Security tip" >

To increase security, it is recommended that after a volume is formatted, it is overwritten with random data. However, this process can take some time and may be skipped if required. See section on <A HREF="plausible_deniability.htm">plausible deniability</A> for further details

Once mounted, a virtual drive can be used in the same way <I>as any other drive</I> (e.g. they will appear in Windows Explorer and in Open/Save dialogs shown by applications); transparently encrypting and decrypting your files as and when needed.

In common with most disk encryption systems, FreeOTFE uses an "encrypted master key" system to secure volumes.<P>Every FreeOTFE volume has its own "master encryption key" which is generated when the volume is created. This master key is used to carry out the actual encryption/decryption process used to secure data stored within the volume.<P>A volume's master encryption key is, in turn, encrypted with the (PBKDF2 processed) user's password. As a consequence, FreeOTFE doesn't need to decrypt and re-encrypt the entire volume to change the user's password - only the encrypted master encryption key. This makes changing a volume/keyfile's password an extremely quick, and risk free, operation when compared to a complete volume re-encryption.
